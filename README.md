## About me
<p id="About me">
  Hi! I'm Carlos, it's nice to meet you (or, it's nice to have you here, at any rate üòÅ).
</p>
<p>
  If you are reading this, you might be interested in a bit of background (and if you aren't, don't worry, I'll be brief). I finished my BSc in Biotechnology in 2017 and my PhD in Biomedical Research in 2023, currently I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher focusing on diagnosis and treatment of epidermal differentiation disorders such as ichthyosis (for more information on what I do, check my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Gutierrez-Cerrajero">ResearchGate profile</a>).<br>
  At this point, you might rightfully be wondering what I'm doing on GitHub (i.e. what does this have to do with coding) and the answer is that while my formal training is almost exclusively molecular biology, I'm interested in bioinformatics, data analysis, and automating computer tasks. So I'm starting a collection of repositories to keep the code I write handy and, if it happens to help other people then even better.
</p>

## What to expect
<p id="What to expect">
  I mostly write in Python and I'm currently in the process of learning R (I also know a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; but I doubt I'll upload much, if anything, written in those languages). As for the actual projects, this is a directory of what is currently available (sorted into repository lists):<br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Bioinformatics: </b>Code that works with molecular biology data (either standard file formats or experiment results):
      <ul>
        <li>Empty, for now</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tools: </b>Programs that carry out a simple function, I may or may not have used them to work with biological data, but they should be easy enough to adapt for other uses either way:
      <ul>
        <li><i><a href="https://github.com/Carlos-Gutierrez-Cerrajero/Mouse-tracker">Mouse tracker</a>:</i> A small program that tracks mouse cursor coordinates and pixel color</li>
        <li><i><a href="https://github.com/Carlos-Gutierrez-Cerrajero/Mouse-wheel">Mouse wheel</a>:</i> A small program that simulates mouse wheel movement when pressing chosen keys</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Practice projects: </b>My answer to a coding challenge found somewhere on the web:
      <ul>
        <li>Empty, for now</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

## Going forward
<p id="Going forward">
  As you may have noticed, this is quite empty at the moment. The order of business will be to first clean and upload already-made programs that I have lying around on my computer (mostly bioinformatics and tools) and then keep uploading new programs I write for work and practice projects when I have the time and inclination to code them.<br>
  <b>WARNING:</b> as you may have guessed from the <a href="#About me">About me</a> section, I am mostly self-taught (except for a couple of introductory classes I took during my Bachelor's degree). In practice, this means that my code will most likely not be optimized or follow style or best practice guidelines. Feedback in this regard is appreciated within reason (for instance, I will not take into consideration recommendations to learn a different language just because code would be slightly faster, and I might not implement recommended changes if I don't have the time or skill to do so).<br>
  With that out of the way, make yourself comfortable, feel free to introduce yourself and enjoy!
</p>
